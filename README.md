**Performance testing**
The aim of this project is to evaluate the performance of the page www.espritshop.pl during the sale time.
I used JMeter to perform testing on 3 groups: 10 users, 100 users and 500 users. All the details about project assumptions and results
are in the file "Test Scenario".
Moreover I applied two kinds of assertions: duration and size .
